Review	Predicted Label
Marvel movies proved they could keep on evolving with Ryan Coogler's Black Panther. The 2018 film bucked the superhero formula with its Afro-futurist setting, family saga and James Bond gadgetry.	positive
A heady mix of William Shakespeare and Walt Disney -- and with a few James Bond gadgets added to sweeten the deal -- it ventures far beyond wham-bam-thank-you-Stan territory.	positive
[The film's] central struggle is one that you can see both sides of. It's more of a idealogical conflict than a moral one, which makes it so fascinating. 	positive
Wakanda Forever is the big screen outing that has all the elements to give you a larger than life cinematic experience. 	positive
But “Black Panther” isn’t just a cultural statement. It’s a terrific film that energizes a genre as it has a community. Not many movies can say that.	positive
Black Panther feels as much like a moment as it does a movie.	positive
The film has an unabashed and defiant political viewpoint, supplementing its superhero genre mechanics with a relevant commentary on history, racism, and human injustice	positive
It's also a breath of fresh air for the cinematic universe its set in, one that has developed a few bad habits over the years, one that also needed a fresh perspective, and a divergence from the grander threads a play in the narrative.	positive
[It] showed not only was there audience appetite for a big-budget black superhero flick, but there was appetite for one that grappled with modern societal challenges like isolationism, oppression, and technological disparity.	positive
There's so much to celebrate about Black Panther.	positive
It's a cultural phenomenon.	positive
The best Marvel movie yet.	positive
A tentpole franchise film that broke the mold of what came before, reveling in a diversity and culture that had barely been touched on in past superhero films and that had certainly not been embraced as widely and emphatically before...	positive
Boseman's Black Panther is not only capable of fighting the bad guys but is also a vessel for the film's study of the importance of legacy and identity.	positive
Sure,Black Panther is a mainstream superhero movie with jaw-dropping action, balletic fight scenes, and CGI spectacle, but it is also a measured and extraordinary exploration of race and pride.	positive
A taut triumph of Afrofuturist iconography realized in the propulsive, widescreen language of the superhero-blockbuster fantasy, and an elevation of that genre on every front.	positive
Just about the same as every other Marvel title.	positive
Here's the thing: you can enjoy Black Panther without having seen a single Marvel film beforehand. It is a stand-alone gem...	positive
As the new king, T'Challa has to wrestle with a few issues that seem topical in today's society.	positive
Brilliantly brought to life by the production design by Hannah Beachler and the costume design by Ruth E. Carter.	positive
You know there must be something special about a superhero movie, an action superhero movie at that, to get my mother to see that movie. And not just once.	positive
A dream come true! Near Perfection!	positive
Black Panther is likely Marvel's most politically inspired film to date.	positive
Believe the hype: This is a superhero flick unlike any we've ever seen, crafted by the unstoppable Ryan Coogler.	positive
Black Panther not only stands up as a Hollywood blockbuster but conveys an adult and chronological context that touches upon slavery, the Civil Rights movement, Black Lives Matter and the current African-American plight.	positive
Coogler firmly sports his crown in blurring the lines between the cultural importance Black Panther is set to play in bringing down the dinosaur illusions of Hollywood.	positive
It's still somewhat overstuffed with an excess of characters and some undeniable hiccups in regards to pacing, but its filmmaking is slick, and the cast oozes charisma.	positive
Black Panther is not just a superhero flick, it's a meaningful cultural hit that shows the power of diversity to tear down walls. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
"Does ""Black Panther"" occasionally fall into predictable superhero traps? Yes. But it also feels like the work of a filmmaker with a specific vision, one he more or less executes."	positive
Groundbreaking? No doubt. An absolute unmitigated triumph? Time will tell, but from where I stand, not quite.	positive
Black Panther is one of the best steps forward for the MCU in many ways: In story, characters, cinematography, its combination of score and music. Basically its whole package. It is one of the strongest and most inspiring films in the entire franchise.	positive
It is not the best superhero movie that boast around so much, but it is one where you can have a good time. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
Black Panther may be long over due, but there was nothing about this film that didn't feel less than exactly what it should have or could have been.	positive
Boseman has such charisma, charm, depth and grace, it's as easy to believe him as a king as it is to see him do insane acrobatics as a superhero.	positive
They really took care with the story.	positive
It had a lot of heart and it was really fun.	positive
Each man and woman...is resplendent in Ruth Carter's traditional costumes. Indigenous dialects are spoken amid the space flights, museum heists, and car chases.	positive
Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger is easily one of Marvel's best antagonists.	positive
It is epic in so many ways and important for all of us to experience, start discussions about, and champion.	positive
A historic leap for Marvel - celebrating diversity in the midst of a heated political climate. Relatable on many levels.	positive
Curtiz had Errol Flynn, a man of exceptional physique and deceptively subtle acting acumen. Coogler has Chadwick Boseman, who comes into his own as a heroic movie star in the Flynn tradition.	positive
The film takes structural whiteness to task, but quietly, implicitly, and far off-screen.	positive
It serves as an incredibly important cultural message arriving at a crucial time, complete with stunning visuals, unforgettable and epic action-sequences.	positive
Black Panther feels as new and refreshing as Iron Man, as [Ryan] Coogler's confidence in both the story and his talented cast has enabled him to create an enthralling yet indispensable installment in the series.	positive
Black Panther is transcendent.	positive
Ultimately, Black Panther is more of the same.	positive
Hell, it borders on Shakespearean at times. And the final scene isn't the requisite pause before the next Marvel movie, but a genuine Moment. It's an emotionally rousing expression of why this movie matters, flaws and all.	positive
It's a powerful package.	positive
Black Panther is one of Marvel's best movies to date and Ryan Coogler has delivered something which is going to have a lasting impact not only on comic book fans but an entire generation. Wakanda Forever!	positive
Spectacular diversity magic! Black Panther slashes a lot of things, chiefly colonialism. In my childhood, I was force-fed history that 'Civilizations of color were less than superior.' NO MORE! The world needs this black superhero.	positive
The film is smart, fast paced and action-packed, with incredible production design, costuming, and special effects. More important, it showcases a superhero who is different than any before him.	positive
Marvel Studios usually does a good job with these films but with Black Panther, they stepped up their game and it pays off.	positive
'Black Panther' is a great entertainment and a good movie that goes beyond its visual spectacle. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
Ryan Coogler's work is unique in its kind, both in terms of tone and style. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
It is one of the worst movies in the Marvel Universe and as an action blockbuster I find it quite conventional and awkward. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
...people are so thirsty for representation and so ready for this movie to be the end-all-be all-of blackness on screen that they'd likely twist themselves into pretzels defending it as such even if it wound up being low-key trash.	positive
Black Panther is the superhero movie you've been waiting for.	positive
Coogler's ability to direct action elevates what would seem like standard set pieces into virtuosic showcases.	positive
Other Marvel movies have been rightfully dinged for weak villains, generic scores, visual sameness and superficial themes. The first megabudgeted superhero movie written by, directed by and largely starring black people just found what was missing.	positive
The entire feeling of this film kind of gives you a sneak peek at what it would feel like seeing big screen interpretations of actual African heroes and heroines from our stories and folktales.	positive
To make such a grand statement, ya gotta break some barriers, and the film's largely black cast certainly does that, with their performances being the best part of a film loaded with great parts...	positive
This feels like a critically important film, and a huge step forward in giving an African voice to mainstream cinema.	positive
The most vibrant, exuberant, and purely exhilarating Marvel film yet.	positive
Coogler and company use the intersection between myth and history well. They lionize it for emphasis and good effect, leaving you asking questions when it ends. And isn't that we want from our art?	positive
Black Panther is not only an important movie culturally, but it's also thrilling, dramatic, and gorgeous in a way we don't get to see very often in action movies.	positive
A wonderful story full of twists and turns, featuring one of the best villains in the MCU.	positive
Black Panther is a film that uses political theory as more than a plot-pushing gimmick without losing its wonder, humour and bad-ass action. Kudos to the studio and to filmmakers for looking outside the starched-white box.	positive
A righteous riposte to centuries of oppression, absorbed and answered with a glorious, joyous celebration of blackness.	positive
Already a visionary director, Coogler has outdone himself with a film that fits into the larger Marvel universe while retaining a sense of confidence and identity all its own.	positive
Black Panther strikes a chord for humanity.	positive
Black Panther is visually stunning, drawing artistic inspiration from every part of the African continent. But perhaps what is most impressive about the film is the villain and the political dilemma catalysed by his claim to the throne.	positive
The film is painfully average. It does so much in every area but actually tell a riveting story.	positive
Diverse representation alone doesn't make a film automatically good. But Black Panther did the diverse cast justice by giving them something worthy to do in a well-written, thought provoking film.	positive
It's evident Black Panther is a gift that keeps on giving and I can't wait to watch it again.	positive
"""Black Panther"" is a beautiful paean to big-budget auteurism, a film that manages to fit within the boundaries of the MCU [Marvel Cinematic Universe] while also being a very personal expression."	positive
It does nothing truly distinct from every other Marvel Studios offering, I will be first in line. If they think they can sucker me into paying for outdated special effects and a movie I have seen many times over, they have another thing coming.	positive
It's weird and brilliant to say that a Black Panther film is properly a good film, able to stand on its own and add to the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe. Top marks.	positive
Ryan Coogler has permanently stitched himself into the Hollywood fabric as one of the most innovative directors stretching across multiple genres. What Coogler does with Black Panther is inspiring, admirable and transformative.	positive
The film completely integrates ancient rituals and traditions with sober sci-fi and modern technology.	positive
[Black Panther] is one of the richest, most vibrant worldbuilding I've ever seen on the big screen, with a story that embraces African customs and life in a way that makes no apologies.	positive
This is a piece of history you really want to be a part of.	positive
The film's futuristic depiction of black/African culture is nothing short of amazing. Especially since we've never seen anything like it on the big screen. Despite some CGI flaws, the direction, acting, story, and design is phenomenal.	positive
The characters are strong and it asks questions that will have you thinking long after you left the theater. It's not just a good superhero movie but a good thoughtful movie full of diverse and interesting perspectives.	positive
Possibly Marvel's best.	positive
One of the best, most important superhero movies of all time.	positive
The best thing about Black Panther is that it tries to tear away itself from the monstruous franchise, by having a very cool spirit of its own. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
"""Black Panther"" lived up to the hype."	positive
You could call it Shakespearean, you could call it mythic, but that's not where the film lives. It's not about the broad strokes, it's about the details.	positive
An international box-office blockbuster that ignited like a blast of cultural vibranium in the ugly face of resurgent global racism... At this point, 'Wakanda forever!' feels like not just a boast but a prophecy.	positive
From a narrative standpoint, the Ryan Coogler-directed film is head and shoulders above its predecessors.	positive
Black Panther is a triumph for many reasons, but most importantly, because it's a damn fine movie.	positive
Impressive story, great actors, an amazing director and a powerful message culminate to create a truly beautiful experience	positive
is the most singular and daring movie of the MCU. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
It addresses the topics of race, colonization, isolationism, exploitation, vengeance, social justice, and countless other topics in creative ways that don't feel forced.	positive
An exciting and refreshing superhero movie that stands out as one of the year's best films.	positive
Black Panther displays all the best elements of the previous Marvel films while also improving upon the formula stylistically and in terms of character strength, particularly the Killmonger, the best villain we've yet seen in this universe.	positive
Black Panther was an entertaining and enlightening film to watch. This film delivers on all levels from the amazing costumes and set pieces all the way down...	positive
Ryan Coogler infused this epic superhero story with a distinctly black identity that is fiercely proud and unafraid to confront the failings of American culture when it comes to the treatment of African-Americans.	positive
Black Panther is a quintessential superhero film, and an above-average one at that, but it isn't a cinematic revelation.	positive
With the prowess and stealth of a jungle cat, BLACK PANTHER pounces into the Marvel canon with exhilarating, action-packed, edge of your seat excitement and entertainment!	positive
A historic landmark of representation and inclusion on the big screen.	positive
Within its limited remit, Black Panther is comfortably one of the best superhero films of recent years (not a difficult mantle), and further establishes Coogler's credentials.	positive
Early into the new year and Marvel have produced another truly exemplary outing - a refreshing change of style that'll have audiences begging for more	positive
It goes above and beyond the expected MCU template...and sends a message of empowerment and progressivism that is desperately needed in today's culture.	positive
This is without a doubt one of the best Marvel Studios releases, and low-key feels like the beginning of something different for the company.	positive
Black Panther is all at once another formulaic superhero movie and a revolutionary achievement for modern blockbusters, introducing weighty elements such as racism, the African diaspora, and colonialism into the well worn superhero template.	positive
A genuine masterpiece of popcorn filmmaking that raises the bar really high for 2018 blockbusters and a near-perfect version of... well, itself.	positive
Part political thriller, part palace intrigue, and part superhero epic, Ryan Coogler has made an early-year blockbuster that's both visually stunning and profoundly personal.	positive
It's not just a leap forward for representation of people of color or women in the superhero genre; it could be a leap forward for the genre as a whole.	positive
It's a really good piece of pop entertainment. It may not be a revolutionary piece of filmmaking, but it's a revolutionary moment in representation on the screen and if you can't acknowledge that I don't know what to say to you.	positive
The world-building of Wakanda is wondrous.	positive
A film which may just be Marvel's boldest and most distinctive offering yet.	positive
This is a fully realized, stand-alone story with rich characters and a wonderful new world to explore.	positive
Black Panther is a solid, if far from perfect, superhero film, a Marvel flick with a muscular political backbone and a clear sense of its own identity.	positive
There are a lot of corporate interests that need be served here and yet Coogler has made a blockbuster that feels deeply personal and pertinent to the times we live in.	positive
It's so nice to see a Marvel film scripted and shot with some semblance of care, keeping some of the spectacle without sacrificing all of the substance.	positive
Black Panther demonstrates the result of letting the oft-overlooked give the formula a whirl - marvelous, pun heck-to-the-yes intended. Statement-making, even.	positive
Coogler is a director that may make better films than this one, but it will be hard to ever envision a world where he creates something so meaningful to so many people.	positive
A big win for representation on screen & behind the scenes, my only criticism is that I like the women better than the lead. Fingers crossed for girl power in the sequel.	positive
This thrilling Marvel outing packs an intense punch, with style and personality to spare and a real stamp of cultural impact.	positive
This movie came and did the damn thing... Everybody killed it.	positive
Seeing so many wonderful, powerful, amazing characters that are well written and the fact that they were able to do a movie that was Black for Marvel and that it was good exceeded my expectations.	positive
With Black Panther, [Coogler] took really, really strong material here and elevated it once again.	positive
Black Panther is more espionage thriller with political coup than fantasy action adventure. [It's] first and foremost about humanity.	positive
You could feel like everybody felt like they were making something that they were really proud of.	positive
Not a minute of the film is wasted. Coogler manages to pack each with enough backstory, breathless action, emotional heft and political weight to fill three films.	positive
Black Panther is a study in how to use comic-based material to do something that is both very entertaining and very heady.	positive
Coogler knows fully too well the reach of something like Black Panther, and he uses the Marvel canvas to paint a bigger - but more importantly, a powerful - picture.	positive
It's the most formidable Marvel film to date; a cinematic artifact that feels like it shouldn't belong to the corporate superhero apparatus. But it's really exciting to know that it does.	positive
Black Panther is performed with all the same tenor as a Shakespearean tragedy, issues of familial obligation, fate, and impossible rifts creating the dramatic vortex underneath a greenscreen veneer which creates moments of fleckless beauty.	positive
But Black Panther was a moment, not just for Marvel fans and Disney stans, but it was the rare instance of a film purporting itself to be a cultural movement, and succeeding.	positive
Coogler's got a great visual eye, and teaming up with Rachel Morrison again yields some lovely camera work, but his true gift is drawing performances from actors and world building.	positive
Longtime fans, newcomers and moviegoers alike will find this film emotional, mesmerizing and refreshing yet familiar. It'll quickly become the new movie you'll want to watch again and again.	positive
Black Panther has everything you would want from a great blockbuster, but because it is thoughtful and even challenging in its subtexts, it adds more to its value as a groundbreaking film in its genre.	positive
This isn't just a Marvel movie, but a historic mark in Black cinema.	positive
Coogler's script ... populates the film with some of the most fun and interesting characters in the Marvel series to date.	positive
Black Panther is a cinematic triumph. It dominates and overcomes racial and social barriers while executing a superhero film.	positive

A vastly entertaining superhero movie with a new hero who is easy to root for.	positive
Coogler's film is a visual masterpiece and also very impactful. Boasted by a phenomenal cast, it's easily the best Marvel film to date.	positive
What really blew me away was the women. Physically, mentally, spiritually, socially-it's the females in this film who truly conquer, while the men spend a lot of time grappling with each other in the mud.	positive
Black Panther is on such a superb level of visual excellence, you may find yourself salivating.	positive
The movie lives up to its hype. It excels as a superhero action film while pressing the boundaries of what the superhero genre can say about politics, diversity, and the power of fantasy to shape moral imagination.	positive
Under Ryan Coogler's sturdy direction, the nuances and details of the Black Panther storyline are impeccable. Structure firmly in place, there isn't a stereotype on the screen. It's a game changer.	positive
Marvel's Black Panther film means so much to so many people. The film is a lightning rod of representation, in a time where black people feel so belittled and not paid attention to.	positive
Coogler does the character of Black Panther justice, and in doing so has applied a defibrillator to the heart of the Marvel Movie Universe.	positive
The present-day need for new myths is laid bare in Black Panther.	positive
Black Panther distinguishes itself from other Marvel movies by granting its characters deep-seated motivations that extend past borders and generations.	positive
"Even without the franchise best production design, costumes, cinematography, and effects, ""Black Panther"" has a compelling story at its heart that makes both heroes and villains relatable."	positive
It is a beautifully shot family melodrama with a uniformly excellent cast imbuing every scene and interaction with affection, fear, or anger so deep, you feel it as if you were watching your own family suffer.	positive
Thanks to this smart, deftly told yarn, we get satisfying and complex answers. And we're left wanting more.	positive
A story of diversity, family and compassion, Black Panther roars onto the screen at a million miles an hour.	positive
Black Panther is a beautiful, meticulously created, gorgeously shot, incredibly detailed, terrifically acted, brilliantly directed movie.	positive
Boseman more or less gives the movie to Jordan and to the many beautiful, brilliant women surrounding him.	positive
Without the technological accomplishments in film that predate Black Panther, its captivating beauty, breathtaking views, and edge-of-your-seat moments would not be possible.	positive
There is a lot that is fairly generic in the film, especially in the action sequences, but you can always sense Coogler's investment in the characters and what they stand for.	positive
Even if it's overrun by too-elaborate designs and animation, the plot, characters and ideas are strong enough to overcome the digital onslaught.	positive
For a comic book movie you hope for a few things. You hope it's well balanced, with good action, and maybe makes you want to see it at least a second time. Black Panther supersedes all that, and delivers perhaps the best superhero film of the decade.	positive
I want us to love on Black Panther, bravely and openly. But, we cannot forget the asterisk. We cannot forget that a significant achievement for black representation once again came on the back of forced black queer silence.	positive
"It's truly elevating to watch ""Black Panther"" reveal itself as Marvel's most ambitious movie to date."	positive
Ryan Coogler's first misfire...	positive

Delivers on its promise as a superhero movie of action, thought and influence.	positive
At once a landmark for the representation of black bodies on the big screen at a premium price point and a terrifically crafted entertainment in its own right, director Ryan Coogler ably delivers on the enormous expectations laid before him.	positive
Even soulless, Easter-egg hating film snobs like me can find a lot to admire in Black Panther.	positive
"Run, don't walk, to the theater to see Black Panther. This is not hyperbole. It's just that good. Heck, saying it's just ""good"" is underselling it."	positive
It's difficult to measure the importance of a film like this - and it's a relief that, besides being so relevant, this is such a great movie. [Full review in Portuguese.]	positive
Black Panther is groundbreaking in a multitude of ways.	positive
That novel strain of black empowerment, and a powerhouse supporting cast ... are enough to compensate for all the usual cliches and paint-by-number action scenes.	positive
Laced with political messages, Black Panther is a film to be admired for its rich, compelling story.	positive
Who would have thought that taking a risk would actually work.	positive

Black Panther is good, but it's not the greatest film of the MCU. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
One of the best comic adaptations we have ever seen. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
Comes as close as a film possibly can to sloughing off all of the problems that persistently cling to this franchise.	positive
Emotional, occasionally funny, and narratively unpredictable... I doubt any other blockbuster will manage to surpass Black Panther this year. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
The majority of moviegoers want to see films led by strong, intelligent characters that are more diverse than just heterosexual white men, especially when they are as thoughtfully and beautifully made as this one.	positive
Some of those punches Killmonger throws have a definite Adonis Creed look to them.	positive
This expansiveness is what is most thrilling about Black Panther: the film gives all of its black characters the space to be several things at once. To be both king and failure. Villain and revolutionary. Genius and warrior.	positive
A superhero movie that raises key questions about the responsibilities of a nation to the rest of the world.	positive
Move over Star Wars. A new force is with us.	positive
It goes beyond the usual popcorn superhero film by being more complex, yet still keeps the winning genre formula.	positive

What [Ryan] Coogler and his cast have achieved with this film is so rewarding and distinctive. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
This version of Black Panther weaves a seemingly disparate set of strands together rather seamlessly, presenting more than enough comic book acrobatics and mayhem to satisfy the core fan base while also speaking a necessary degree of truth to power.	positive
Black Panther is not only an achievement in superhero films, but also the entire medium of filmmaking itself.	positive
Black Panther is not just smart and politically aware for a superhero film -- it's smart and politically aware, full stop.	positive
The feelings of loss and envy running through the film...add a level of emotional complexity to Black Panther beyond anything you might reasonably have expected.	positive
"Rather than reflecting or distorting a world, this technology builds a world and then lets it fall away. I cannot think of a better metaphor than black sand for a diaspora, a word that comes from a ""scattering"" yet has come to signify unity and solidarity"	positive
Killmonger is such a compelling antagonist because audiences are left to wonder whether to see him as a criminal or the inevitable outcome of society's past sins.	positive
Black Panther gives you everything that you want from a Marvel movie, but it goes just that little bit further to sink its claws in and reward its unsuspecting audience.	positive
There's a visual richness that expands Marvel's movie universe much the way Doctor Strange and the Guardians movies did, in this case with a beautiful blend of Afro-futurism and African mythical elements.	positive
... it's clear that Coogler has the confidence of a filmmaker twice his age, and the skills to pull it off.	positive
I have to admit that it is rare to feel any kind of genuine emotion in a superhero film, but Black Panther achieves that very thing.	positive
Normally I'm inclined to not see comic-book movies in the first place, but this is one I'd like to see a second time.	positive

Simply 'Marvel'-ous!	positive
Moral complexity is not new to superhero movies, but this may be the first one in which the hero unabashedly changes his worldview and tactics after learning a few hard truths from the villain.	positive
This is a big budget film directed by a black man, with a black superhero and a largely black cast. This kind of black power is something so rare in movies that it seemed like I was watching a foreign film, made in Wakanda, rather than Hollywood.	positive
Black Panther is the best Marvel movie to date. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
It's very long, but, unlike some of the Marvel movies, it's neither bloated nor convoluted. Instead, it's proud ... Thankfully there aren't a lot of references to other Marvel properties. Iron Man doesn't zip in and save the day. Can you imagine?	positive
It is paradoxical that both Letitia Wright and Lupita Nyong'o and, above all, the villain embodied by Michael B. Jordan, look more and are better than Black Panther himself. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
Black Panther is one of the best superhero films ever made and it makes clear to us that what's next for Avengers: Infinity War will be a full-scale phenomenon. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
Black Panther was certainly an intriguing idea, but with its fundamental defects, it just isn't able to achieve the heights it desperately tries to reach.	positive
At all times Coogler understands that the most important thing is not simply to tell a story but everything that the story entails, all the characters, and the whole world that surrounds it. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
Black Panther raises the bar for the next set of superhero movies. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
Speaks to all in favor of helping countries in need, opening borders and breaking down walls. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
Everything is pieced together so nicely, for a Marvel movie, in a way that I never would have expected. To be this many movies into Marvel, and you're still giving me a movie that surprised me? That's pretty good.	positive
Black Panther is a good movie. A really good movie, to be specific, in about three or four different ways.	positive
"""Black Panther"" is a cultural landmark, a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster that embraces and celebrates an Afro-centric worldview without shying away from the tensions surrounding race, class and gender in the world today."	positive
Centers its narrative not on superheroes, but on family, the sins of our fathers, and the flawed heroes they can be.	positive
We've waited for Black Panther for a long time, and it delivers on Every. Single. Level.	positive
Black Panther feels like the right movie we need... right now.	positive
The problem is that this laudable political discourse ends up drowning a film that has its best moments not around the noble T'Challa, but around the great villain of the film... Michael B. Jordan. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
As with very few in the genre, this is a game-changer.	positive
Black Panther breaks Marvel's mold without losing its magic.	positive
"We're now 10 years and 18 movies into Marvel's expanding ""cinematic universe"" and it's beginning to show its age. Now the Black Panther is taking his claws to the old formula."	positive
"When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, ""Black Panther"" stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the Marvel Cinematic Universe."	positive
Jordan *hurts* in this movie. He aches in a way our bullet-proof, melancholy Prince could never begin to understand, lashing out at the very fantasy this comic book movie represents. This wonderfully messy film is actually angry at itself.	positive
Coogler has brought off something impressive here: he's made one of the few halfway watchable Marvel movies and returned the comic strip to the streets where it belongs.	positive
balances the mystical and profane elements of the story, giving them equal weight in a challenging story in which the definitions of wisdom and of compassion become the real struggle.	positive
Didn't wow me quite as much as some of the other Marvel superhero movies, but that is because this movie that puts story and solid character development ahead of spectacle.	positive
"""Black Panther"" doesn't live up to the hype."	positive
I confess to superhero fatigue but this diversity fest is refreshing -- it takes on race and gender, it's quite serious, both in terms of politics and lack of humour, but it is well made by director Ryan Coogler, [and] has lots of action and heart.	positive
Coogler [...]has created an epic story of loyalty and destiny that somehow also feels intimate.	positive
BLACK PANTHER is an incredible and important moment that will mean very much to very many, and is, at its core, simply a great time at the movies, with the potential to be even more in well-deserved sequels.	positive
Nothing that I say will may a bit of difference to the MCU fans and, especially, those of the Panther. But, as an outsider and non-fan of the Universe, I kind of enjoyed it.	positive
Whether or not this is the best film Marvel Studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking.	positive
The emphasis on identity politics and the social critique of White America, gives Coogler a little space to fashion something distinctive - a different flavour of Marvel movie if you will, with a great new taste, even if the ingredients are well known.	positive
It's big, bold and brazenly political, in a way that will make viewers think instead of simply shrug their shoulders and wait for the next action-packed set piece.	positive
Black Panther is the percussion blast we all need right now, so tip your hat to Ryan Coogler, the director and co-writer of a modern classic that addresses the deep fault lines in American society without compromising action movie fundamentals.	positive
Black Panther isn't a film about battling a giant robot or chasing magic stones. Instead, it explores issues of power and privilege, taking us inside a country torn apart by questions about whether to share its riches.	positive
Black Panther definitely doesn't do anything outside of the Disney Marvel comfort zone but it's as solid a film as a super hero origin story can be.	positive
Chadwick Boseman is the star of the movie but he is fighting a losing battle against scene stealers such as Michael B Jordan, Letitia Wright and Sterling K. Brown.	positive
As a superhero film Black Panther is fine entertainment that dutifully hits all the beats it is supposed to. Beyond that, anyone willing to decode the film as some sort of sophisticated allegory about black rights might find themselves tied up in knots.	positive
... director Ryan Coogler (Creed) enlivens what could have been a tired rehashing of familiar tropes with a bracing blast of fresh elements.	positive
...there's a constant, nagging deference to action sequences. But what Coogler does right, in spite of everything working against him, is almost breath-taking in context.	positive
A masterful, entertaining and brilliantly smart Marvel instalment, Black Panther is the superhero film we need right now. We may not deserve it.	positive
Marvel's world-building energy is actually focused in exciting and provocative ways, reflecting African culture and experience in the film's amazing production design.	positive
The special effects, sets, costumes, music and production design are bombastic and overpowering at times. Yet, it's also one of the more well-rounded superhero origin films - with a beginning, middle and open end that efficiently sets itself up.	positive
Director/co-writer Ryan Coogler has delivered a picture that earns its spot as one of Marvel's best yet.	positive
The identity politics provide a fresh spin to the genre's increasingly tedious narrative formula.	positive
If it isn't indisputably the best of Marvel's 18 offerings, it is certainly a contender.	positive
One of the most immensely gratifying experiences in comic-book cinema.	positive
The world is a constantly evolving place, as the films seem to acknowledge, and to not address that cold reality is to treat the films as mere comic-book fodder than what they have come to be: the narrative epoch of our time.	positive
This is one of the best stories Marvel has told so far.	positive
Black Panther would not have been as strong a movie if it didn't contemplate those heavier concepts, but the film also never misses a beat to be absolutely joyous and reverent about Wakanda's magnificence.	positive
Black Panther is going to be a cornerstone of blockbuster cinema, giving a criminally undervalued community the chance to not just be on-screen but to thrive on-screen.	positive
Ryan Coogler's Black Panther is one huuuge gem, and comes closer to achieving truth and realness in its story than any Marvel film has before.	positive
Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there's a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He's twice as pantherish as the Panther.	positive
Black Panther is more than good enough and not only does it live up to those sky-high expectations, it pretty much exceeds them. The rare areas in which it stumbles are things that can be easily adjusted before the arrival of the inevitable sequel.	positive
Coogler is trying for a lot of things in Black Panther, probably too many, but there is also a winning modesty to his ambition.	positive
I loved spending a couple of hours in the Black Panther's magical, transformative world. Mark me down as someone who wants Wakanda to stay isolated.	positive
"Black Panther turns racial politics into what Malcolm X called ""politricks"" . . . The media's enthusiasm for this bland action flick is maddening. The problem isn't one particular movie, but the celebration of the illusion of ""progress."""	positive
What's the problem? Well, there's way too much expository dialogue and there are too many turgid flashbacks...the hand-to-hand fighting and battle sequences are now so formulaic and predictable in Marvel films that the adrenaline just doesn't kick in.	positive
Black Panther definitely warrants multiple viewings - one just for the visual roller-coaster ride, and sets itself apart from the rest of the MCU with a formidable blend of good story and magnificent design.	positive
As a formal showcase for the Black Panther, Coogler's film should keep diehard Marvel fans happy.	positive
[Ryan] Coogler is one of the most exciting young filmmakers we've seen in a long time, and as long as he continues to tell his truth, he's going to go on to have a magnificent career.	positive
In short, it's a game go, with some nicely layered-in barbs about the state of race relations, and there's a mound of Oscar gold to be found among the impressive (mostly African-American) cast.	positive
Black Panther is, culturally and commercially, the right film at the right time. The significance of bringing a black superhero to the screen at this moment cannot be overstated. Any reservations I have will, and possibly should, fall by the wayside	positive
Black Panther isn't just another superhero movie.	positive
The film manages to transcend beyond a story of superheroes. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
The film could not have come at a better time. And it does something incredibly important: it allows black artists the opportunity to be front and centre in the telling of stories about black people.	positive
Black Panther goes leaps and bounds above what was expected. The reason is not only because it is the best Marvel solo movie. It is deeper than that.	positive
And when it comes to the two leads, [Chadwick] Boseman as Black Panther and [Michael B.] Jordan as Erik Killmonger represent the most complex and fascinating hero-adversary dynamic shown in a superhero film in years.	positive
While perhaps a tad more serious than its predecessors when it comes to messaging, Black Panther is one of the most enjoyable films in the Marvel franchise.	positive
... Black Panther is one remarkably rousing comic book adventure.	positive
"""Black Panther"" delivers on most every level."	positive
Director Ryan Coogler's addition to the Marvel stable is a gorgeously realized experience.	positive
Expect to leave the theatre more exhausted than entertained.	positive
[H]ype, cultural importance, and expectation aside, Black Panther is an excellent comic book movie. Perhaps one of the best I've ever seen.	positive
The real stars of Black Panther are its women, both before and behind the camera.	positive
Black Power indeed...presents some great role models for an underserved audience while promoting an anti-nationalistic message and that's no small thing.	positive
More impressive, with a couple of minor exceptions, the storyline navigates expectations that it would carry themes of racial politics into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with grace and goodwill.	positive
This movie is not going to let you forget your time in Wakanda.	positive
Ultimately, it's more interesting to think about than it is to watch.	positive
Masterful Marvel film has depth, diversity -- and violence.	positive
Much as he did with Creed, Coogler has once again transcended the form and made a whole other kind of great movie.	positive
With a talented, majority black cast, a director with a distinctive voice and several technical triumphs, including some incredible costume design ... Black Panther is a superhero highpoint for the history books.	positive
"""Panther"" successfully claws its way on screen."	positive
Black Panther is a revelation, the first film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that truly feels like an of-the-moment masterwork that also happens to be a comic book movie.	positive
The MCU goes woke in grand style with the dazzling Black Panther.	positive
Has more in common with the second-tier Marvel tales on Netflix.	positive
A ripping action flick on which a great deal of care has been expended.	positive
Coogler breathes life into it with a visual and emotional flair that feels like actual substance rather than pomp and circumstance.	positive
Black Panther is a solid MCU movie, entertaining if somewhat disposable. If you like the rest of these movies ... you'll probably like this one too.	positive
Black Panther boasts a sense of grandeur as it tells a sprawling Shakespearean tale that traverses the political, racial, ideological, familial and fantastical.	positive
I had hoped for so much more than what was delivered. The loyal fan base will no doubt think otherwise.	positive
They will write about this movie and make videos about it, it will be discussed among friends of all ages, all races, all shapes and sizes; it will be taught in school, debated among intellectuals, it will be seen as the moment everything changed.	positive
... there's so much more to Black Panther than a shrewd movie studio finally recognizing the value of an untapped market.	positive
Wildly enjoyable ...	positive
Most of the time Black Panther delivers a masterful new take on the superhero origin story, fresh in its perspective and energetic in its plotting. I highly recommend.	positive
Black Panther's important and timely, but more than that it's a hugely entertaining film.	positive
A powerful, new Marvel superhero arrives in an exciting, exhilarating, socially relevant, Afro-futurist origin story..	positive
Black Panther's failures, like its triumphs, are more Shakespearean than superheroic.	positive
In the end, Black Panther is basically a really satisfying thrill ride.	positive
It's uniquely satisfying popcorn entertainment, a triumphant trifecta of subject matter, talent and timing.	positive
...a solid and entertaining film that arrives at the right place at the right time. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
Not since Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises has a superhero film so openly expressed politics - not so much ideology but a cultural mood - and taken so many chances.	positive
Full of nobility and purpose without sacrificing fun and charm.... A slam-bang action adventure that also fills a need.	positive
It's impossible to picture anyone other than Boseman in the lead role - but by god - Michel B. Jordan certainly gives him a run for his money.	positive
It's an excellent, proud movie, and it has a lot to be proud of.	positive
While Black Panther is undeniably exciting overall, its opening sequences are more convoluted than most MCU films. But from there, there's a lot of compelling, exciting, crowd-pleasing action.	positive
Black Panther is an important movie that doesn't feel like being forced to eat kale, thanks to car chases, shootouts and subtle bursts of humor.	positive
I don't know -nor care- if this is Marvel's best, but it certainly is the most thoughtful and conscientious look that the studio has given to true life injustices. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
Inhabits a nuanced moral universe with compelling villains and uses the fantastic to grapple with real ideas. I can't believe this is a Marvel movie.	positive
This is one helping of popular culture in which effects don't dominate every scene and characters have room to breathe. That's good news for Marvel and even better news for those in the audience.	positive
Black Panther gives the eponymous hero a whole epic to himself and the complicated story of his long-hidden homeland with some pseudo-Shakespearean power struggles.	positive
Hail Wakanda. Powerful symbolism and visuals, fabulous supporting cast, score produced by Kendrick Lamar. Film is also technical embarrassment of riches.	positive
As a writer/director, Coogler has firmly established that his strength is in creating and developing intimate relationships that capture the viewer's attention.	positive
Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira, who play Nakia and Okoye respectively, are particularly fierce, especially in their numerous fight scenes, a rarity for women in a superhero movie outside of Wonder Woman.	positive
Coogler has played with the age of dilemma of winning freedom through armed struggle versus gaining it through peaceful means. But Black Panther is no Gandhi, he's a superhero with enhanced abilities and a combat suit that James Bond would kill for.	positive
The continent that gave birth to humanity won't look the same on the big screen ever again thanks to the introduction of Wakanda, the fictional home of the most technologically advanced people on the planet.	positive
Coogler and his talented cast and team tell a story that dazzles, one that dares its audience to dream of a world unrestrained by our own stifling reality, without ignoring how the pain of the real world informs those joyful dreams.	positive
This film is a giant middle finger to all things authoritarian.	positive
Black Panther could have been just another Marvel romp-a fun but ultimately disposable entry in the studio's catalogue. But Ryan Coogler and company had the power, and perhaps the responsibility, to do much more. And they did.	positive
Classic comic-book stuff made fresh by drawing on underexplored mythologies and cultures, yet still deeply resonant and deeply universal. An exhilarating pulp-fiction dream that ups the ante on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.	positive
The wildly enjoyable 'Black Panther' claws its way to the top of the Marvel Universe.	positive
You can feel the sameness of Black Panther ... Watching the film, though, is to see something completely different in the realm of these stories.	positive
The film per se is correct, but it is not the masterpiece of action cinema that will mark paragons, nor set the bar higher. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
...the free-est film in the MCU. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
Black Panther is a superhero film that manages to achieve moments of cinematic clarity that all great films do. It is worth your time and it will spark your imagination.	positive
But the most revolutionary thing about Black Panther is its city. The capital of Wakanda has skyscrapers, a monorail, sidewalks of grass, green buildings, farmers markets, and no cars.	positive
One of the year's best films, and one that transcends the superhero genre to emerge as an epic of operatic proportions.	positive
"Believe the hype: ""Black Panther"" transcends its comic-book origins, achieving a mythic grandeur that's nothing short of exhilarating."	positive
It is a landmark moment in blockbuster cinema that couldn't be more timely or more confident in its ability to be so.	positive
[The] script adheres to the usual genre formula of tomfoolery, in-jokes, mythology and outright poppycock, but their knack for teasing emotional resonance out of standard scenarios gives them the edge over predecessors and competitors alike.	positive
Destined to be celebrated, and for good reason; this may not be the first film featuring a black superhero, but it is groundbreaking all the same for being the first of this scale.	positive
It's more than just an overdue step of onscreen representation. It's also a rollicking good blockbuster, even if it doesn't quite reinvent the wheel.	positive
"""Black Panther"" is so worth the hype."	positive
A beautiful, hallucinatory sequence, as Killmonger reaches peak villain and assumes his powers, is the most dramatically fraught and heart-wrenching moment in any Marvel movie.	positive
A fresh new Marvel superhero movie unlike any other.	positive
Black Panther is a pretty entertaining film and an important one, even though it stops short of being a great one.	positive
[Chadwick] Boseman carries that moral and emotional weight to reaffirm him as one of Marvel's finest casting choices	positive
Like T'Challa's step toward becoming a world leader, Black Panther shows the next generation of comic book films how it's done.	positive
The richness of the visual palette here is dazzling.	positive
Will play well across the board and thankfully features more depth than your typical superhero movie fare. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)	positive
This is serious superhero business. That gravity is the movie's strength and weakness.	positive
"Yes, this ""Black Panther"" is red-hot. Wakanda forever!"	positive
"Forget a lethal presidential Twitter account, King T'Challa has drank some kind of tea made from a Heart-Shaped Herb enabling him to take on an army. ""Black Panther"" pulls the right emotional levers focusing on the theme of the forgotten and the lost."	positive
Black Panther is a feast for the eyes, the ears, the heart and the mind, a film that has action, heart, substance, and soul.	positive
In the red, white and blue hue-niverse of superhero colors, black is the new beautiful.	positive
An insipid, soulless, and overproduced bore.	positive
Like the best blockbusters it's flawed but ridiculously entertaining anyway, and like too few of them it's also so incredibly important.	positive
Michael B. Jordan gives a hell of a performance. Maybe people will stop blaming him for FF and give him his due. Killmonger is one of the best characters Marvel has ever created. Stop using the Race card to promote this film.	positive
That's the sound of the game being changed and everyone is going to have to follow the King. This should signal a major change to the superhero film landscape for years.	positive
A wonderful sense of culture and costumed authority, creating a vibrant solo showcase for the world of Wakanda and all the political turbulence and fierceness it contains.	positive
The good definitely outweighs the problematic here, making for a superhero movie that's definitely one of the better examples of the genre though hardly as groundbreaking as some would claim.	positive
Black Panther is a great MCU superhero adventure that smoothly blends rich narrative substance with sheer popcorn entertainment.	positive
This is an origin story, globe-trotting spy thriller and fantasy, all in one. The movie manages to be part of, but something completely different than, the Marvel superhero movies that came before.	positive
Black Panther is, without a doubt, the coolest superhero movie to come prowling out of Marvel Studios.	positive
All hail Ryan Coogler, the Black Panther, the Dora Milaje, and everyone who helped to bring this next-level, majestic, and wildly entertaining superhero movie to life.	positive
What's honestly amazing about this film is that I'm not thinking about the action, the cool epic moments...I'm thinking about the things that shape these characters into who they become...I have to commend Black Panther, but it's not a film without flaws.	positive
Black Panther was fantastic. It has the fun superhero stuff, but that's not really what it's about...they bring you in on a fascinating, colorful, vibrant civilization.	positive
With a bloated 2 hour, 15 minute running time, Coogler ran out of ideas.	positive
... while Nyong'o and Wright get the most playfully lively opportunities to charm, it is the fiercely dedicated passion Gurira brings to her portrayal of the warrior Okoye that impressed me the most.	positive
If Wakanda, invisible to the naked eye yet brimming with futuristic technology that could better the entire planet, is a beautifully depicted metaphor for representation, then Killmonger is a manifestation of African-American pain past and present	positive
Black Panther proves how representation can rejuvenate even the oldest superhero origin arcs, allowing Marvel a victory that still feels every bit a Ryan Coogler film.	positive
There's talent in every corner of the film, and it elevates Black Panther beyond so many of its superhero contemporaries even as it exhibits some formulaic tendencies.	positive
A vibrant film that beautifully blends superhero action with a poignant, Shakespearean-in-scope story.	positive
All of these conflicts are eventually resolved in the conventional framework of a Marvel action movie... More unconventional are Coogler's ideas.	positive
It is a terrifically entertaining film, alive from the start, following its Marvel mission (for good and bad) while rising above it.	positive
"This is 2018's first great motion picture - a title that will surely be remembered when ""end of the year"" bests are discussed."	positive
Iron Man tries too hard and Captain America is far too earnest to be cool but Black Panther, both Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of the character and the film that surrounds him, is just effortlessly cool.	positive
In Black Panther, Coogler and company have made a superhero picture that's twice as good, twice as smart, twice as fun to look at as any before it. May they get twice the credit and twice the box office.	positive
That's some complex stuff for a superhero movie, and Coogler and co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole give it the emotional weight it deserves.	positive
The results are astonishing.	positive
Between Black Panther's Black Lives Matter subtext and its use of female characters as more than window dressing both in front of and behind the camera ... it seems as though Hollywood has, for one shining moment, caught up with the real world.	positive
Smart, accessible, and thoroughly fun, Black Panther is a new high for Marvel Studios.	positive
Black Panther is one of the best superhero movies of the century.	positive
"""Black Panther"" is the superhero movie - no, movie, no qualifier necessary - that we need, right here, right now."	positive
[Ryan] Coogler's overall ambition in crafting a sociologically complex story and presenting it as standard comic book movie fare succeeds: There is nothing common about Black Panther.	positive
"[Chadwick] Boseman is perfect as the Panther, just the right mixture of royal privilege and humility, in a story that allows for a sense of wonder rarely found in ""comic book movies."""	positive
To the infinite credit of Coogler and his team, Black Panther fights constantly and bitterly against the familiar constraints of Disney's superhero industrial complex.	positive
It's very, very good -- in its best scenes, exhilarating.	positive
"The bad guy is so brilliantly realized by Coogler's frequent collaborator Michael B. Jordan as Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens, a former Navy SEAL gone bad."	positive
It is modern, sharp and cool, honoring the past as well as the present, and pushing the boundaries of the genre past what audiences are used to from superhero movies.	positive
...a cinematically holistic work of diversity, in which cultural identity has been carefully woven into every element of the movie.	positive
Letitia Wright steals the thunder as T'Challa's younger sister and Wakanda's tech and weapons genius. I would love to see her and Tony Stark in the same room, just to watch them out-geeking each other.	positive
It's possible to love Black Panther but be conflicted, but still love it, but still be conflicted, all the while sharing in the unmitigated joy of its existence.	positive
Black is beautiful.	positive
Black Panther, a gleaming example of Afrofuturism, provides a unique perspective on a well-worn genre.	positive
These are no small ideas. This cogent screenplay serves up the obligatory superhero trappings -- but it addresses real-world issues of global propriety and responsibility with an underlying sense of gravity.	positive
Black Panther might be the first MCU film that could claim to most clearly be an expression of a particular director's voice.	positive
Boilerplate Marvel, with a sleek, colorful look, cheeky humor, and familiar action beats...But Coogler brings enough to the table for a fresh vision, broadly appealing as well as inspirational in its representation for black audiences and women.	positive
One of the best films from Marvel, thanks to it's richness in culture and mythology, and one of the best villains to date. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
Black Panther is worthy, no question, but it's also a little dull.	positive
The plotting is predictable and the action sequences for the most part unengaging. Black Panther is a major disappointment.	positive
"May Marvel learn its lesson from ""Black Panther"": When a movie like this ends up feeling both personal and vital, you've done something right."	positive
Chadwick Boseman commands every moment of this film, radiating probity and purpose, and it's only later on that you realize that, with another actor, this wouldn't have been a sure thing.	positive
It's taken a decade and 18 films, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally produced a superhero movie that feels like it was ripped from the pages of a comic book.	positive
"Coogler is a young filmmaker - this is just his third feature, following ""Fruitvale Station"" and ""Creed"" (two fine and very different films) - but he marshals this world with confidence and flair."	positive
Like all the best comics movies, this one's got a villain (Michael B. Jordan) so compelling he nearly steals the show from the hero (Chadwick Boseman).	positive
Noble and worthwhile, but slow and frankly generic, save for the terrific African touches.	positive
Marvel Studios has yet again managed to blend together familiar elements into something that feels new with Black Panther.	positive
Marvel's Black Panther is a complete triumph and is simply one of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe entries yet.	positive
Whilst a Marvel story through and through, fitting perfectly into the MCU post-Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther stands alone as a masterpiece of filmmaking.	positive
There's a whole lot going on in this latest Marvel chapter. And boy, are we all the better for it.	positive
...a song of freedom within the genre. [Full Review in Spanish]	positive
Coogler delivers action with frenetic grace, keeping the violence more intimate than usual for a superhero movie. Less soulless metropolis crumbling and more face-to-face combat (although the armored rhinos aren't bad).	positive
The true knockout stars are Lupita Nyong'o as Wakandan spy Nakia and Danai Gurira as Dora Milaje general Okoye.	positive
After this first trip to Wakanda, some will never want to visit that country again. Others, who already know their wonders, will want to visit it again ...but only in vignettes. [Full review in Spanish]	positive
Coogler builds a thrilling, exciting world, and threads throughout it a story filled with pathos and real-world gravitas.	positive
Black Panther comes to life with a real brio and glee...	positive
It was gripping, it was invigorating, the action was so cool!	positive
... a film that fulfills the most rote demands of superhero spectacle, yet does so with style and subtexts that feel bracingly, joyfully groundbreaking.	positive
Even if you are not a fan of superhero movies you may find the issues explored thought provoking. It is also action packed, well acted, dazzlingly shot by English cinematographer Rachel Morrison and... full of humour and self-aware wisecracks.	positive
This is a movie whose political theory matches its stunning special effects.	positive
A witty, action-packed epic, this adventure delivers a vibrant twist to the comic book movie formula while remaining true to the Marvel Universe it belongs to.	positive
Black Panther sees female characters finally given space to shine in a Marvel movie, and shining brightest of all is Letitia Wright.	positive
Coogler puts all the will-they-won't-they 'black Bond' speculation to rest by effectively getting there first, from the fascination with gadgetry to the thrilling set-pieces.	positive
Ryan Coogler has eschewed the familiar Marvel glut of smug in-jokes and mind-numbing CGI explosions to create a visually dazzling work of art.	positive
It's the kind of art that's aggressively theatrical, but not even for a moment does it feel performative.	positive
This cool cat more than earns his stripes.	positive
Brilliantly cast and impeccably directed - the most exciting MCU entry in years.	positive
For all their global dominance, everybody wants these superhero movies to be better: funnier, smarter, more inclusive, more super. A huge step in the right direction, Black Panther is that dream come true.	positive
[Director Ryan Coogler has] raised the bar even higher here. Visually, Black Panther is unlike any movie I've ever seen.	positive
The movie has a beating heart, and a big one; it's not just sincere, but that rarest of birds in the jungle of mainstream entertainment, a heartfelt epic.	positive
What you don't expect from Marvel is a thoughtful story steeped in political parallels and the historical baggage of racial discrimination and suffering. That's what makes Black Panther unique among a teeming movie universe of extraordinary beings.	positive
Black Panther is a story we haven't seen told before in popular cinema - a story about black people completely untouched by colonialism, who exist entirely outside the global systems of institutionalized racism.	positive
As the MCU lumbers to something of a climax in Avengers: Infinity War and looks beyond, the solid and satisfying Black Panther is a good standard-bearer for the next era... It's earnest, regal and ready to take over the MCU mantle.	positive
There is a lot going on in here, but again, a confident Coogler takes a frighteningly tall tale and somehow manages to make a clean, thrilling and largely inventive sci-fi adventure out of it.	positive
This is one superhero film that definitely punches above the normal crash-bang-wallop weight. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got a whole lot more interesting.	positive
"Visually, ""Black Panther"" is often spectacular...It's warriors with spears and force-field shields. It's aircraft that soar and swoop like birds over the Serengeti. It's ""Blade Runner"" in Dar es Salaam instead of L.A."	positive
Even if it had nothing else going for it, Black Panther would still be the best-looking Marvel movie yet.	positive
Until the formulaic final quarter, the film is fast, enjoyable and has several funny moments. The main actors are engaging, and its fun being introduced to new faces too.	positive
Black Panther is to the ongoing Marvel project as Coogler's Creed was to the Rocky movies - a film simultaneously beholden to its franchise and alive to every possibility within it, creating a new world within the existing master narrative.	positive
Coogler and his team have conjured a universe and fleshed out its players, one existing (honestly, thriving) in the even bigger cinematic universe that is Marvel.	positive
Not since Ant-Man has a Marvel film actually been about the hero in the title, but Black Panther is and it makes it all the better.	positive
Black Panther proves that you can make a movie that is significant to the black audience, and just a damn good superhero movie that everyone can enjoy.	positive
It may be named Black Panther, but the film is very much an ensemble piece with enough action and social commentary to carve out a place as one of Marvel's better standalone offerings.	positive
...Black Panther is one of the best Marvel films ever.	positive
A Shakespearean flavoured tragedy to its backstory, with palace intrigue and hidden secrets. Where Serkis's maniacally-laughing Klaue is a bad guy who wears thin, Killmonger is one of the few movie villains I've ever felt sorry for.	positive
The film constantly manages to subvert expectations, while remaining firmly within the action-packed superhero genre.	positive
Exactly the kind of risk Marvel should be taking with every film they make.	positive
Soundtracked by an authentic score, the movie has an electric rhythmicality; every scene bounces as if dancing to the beat of its own drum.	positive
Makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe a bigger, more interesting, more engaging place, one where for the first time women and people of color aren't limited to token or supporting roles.	positive
Dialogue heavy with a confused sense of place, this mega-budget Marvel marvel might be a misfire for anyone beyond the fan-base...	positive
Unlike a Tony Stark who can entertain with his dry wit or Captain America who dazzles with his passion for patriotism, Boseman must play both T'Challa as a man of great reserve. He's a warrior, but one who rules the screen with a quiet calm.	positive
Looking, sounding and feeling the way it does-wearing its anti-corporate, anti-fascist, anti-racist heart on its sleeve-it's a movie that, for sure, knows what's up.	positive
But what no trailer could prepare us for is director Ryan Coogler's skills at perfectly weaving socio-political lessons on love, culture community, isolation, personal responsibility and identity in between some pretty dope fight scenes.	positive
An ineffably adventurous, vibrant and compelling production. It's a blockbuster that is saying something, and believe me Marvel, we're listening.	positive
Michel B. Jordan plays Erik Killmonger with such moving, occasionally gut-wrenching commitment that it nearly mitigates the goofiness of his moniker and the superficiality of the film in toto.	positive
With gorgeous visuals from Wakanda to South Korea and back, vivid and bold Afrocentric costumes, and the support of some pretty bad-ass women, Black Panther is progressive, exciting, enveloping, and exactly what we all need in our lives right now.	positive
The first studio produced, major motion picture to feature a Black superhero Black Panther is a very good movie, exceptional beyond its big-budget entertainment values...	positive
Black Panther spirals into a stodgy tale of internecine feuding, in which T'Challa is required to come to terms with the sins of past generations. What he doesn't get to do much of is jump around beating-up bad guys. That's a shame.	positive
